			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

				<p>Hi 👋 Natalia here, thanks for visiting my new website!</p>

				<p>As an Argentinian Lawyer 👩‍⚖️ looking for new challenges (and a bit influenced by relatives), I decided to step away from my formal career and dive into the ICT world to learn about web development 👩‍💻.</p>

				<p>Well organised, independent, problem solver and proactive team player 👯  with high attention to detail 🕵️‍♀️. Fan of exercising 💪, going to the beach 🏖 and doing a bit of shopping 🛍.</p>

				<p>Always curious and eager to learn 👩‍🎓, I built this website using top end tech stack 👷‍♀️. During this journey I learnt about NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, and even Git and Heroku, from where this site is being served 💻, and I believe now I’m ready to formally start my career in the IT industry and show what I am capable of 🙌..</p>

            <h1>SOME BACKGROUND</h1>

           		 <p>Born and raised in Argentina 🇦🇷, at the age of 18 I decided to study Law and graduated in 2014. I worked for two years at a Law Firm 🏢 as an Associate Lawyer and then for two years at the State Court 🏛.</p>

				 <p>But I’ve always felt something was missing in my life 🤔... So, in 2019, I decided to leave my country, my family, my friends and my career and move to Australia 🇦🇺 to find myself and experience living and working abroad 😱.</p>

			 	 <p>During the past months, I’ve worked at two Five-Star Hotels 🏨, the Sydney Tower Eye 🌆 and currently I’m working in the retail industry at UNIQLO 👕👚, but, after too much effort, the moment has finally come and it is time to make my career change and take it to the next level 🚀!</p>

			 	 <p>If you would like to get to know me better and discuss any opportunity, just <a href="#contact" style="color: white">say hola</a> 🙂!</p>
